Usage: ueb02 [-v] OUTPUTFORMAT MATRIXFILE OPERATIONs
       -> specifies an OUTPUTFORMAT, an initial matrix (MATRIXFILE) and
          a (potentially empty) list of OPERATIONs to execute in order.
          Exits with an according error as soon as an OPERATION fails
          or a MATRIXFILE can't be read.

   or: ueb02 -h
       -> print this information

optional arguments:
  -v -> verbose, output the current matrix after every successful step 
          in the given OUTPUTFORMAT to stderr

OUTPUTFORMAT:
  -c -> output in human readable format to stdout
  -f -> output in file-format to stdout

MATRIXFILE:
  a file containing a valid representation of a matrix
       
OPERATIONs:
  (BINARY_OPERATION MATRIXFILE | UNARY_OPERATION)*
  a (potentially empty) list of UNARY_OPERATIONs or BINARY_OPERATIONs
          (with respective MATRIXFILEs) in any order

BINARY_OPERATION:
  -a -> adds the next MATRIXFILE to the current result (using matrix addition)
  -s -> multiplies the next MATRIXFILE as a scalar to the current result
        using scalar multiplication (the next MATRIXFILE has to be a
        1x1-matrix)
  -m -> multiplies the next MATRIXFILE to the current result using matrix
        multiplication

UNARY_OPERATION:
  -d -> calculates the determinant of the current result matrix as a 1x1-matrix
  -i -> calculates the inverse matrix of the current result (2x2-matrices only)
  -t -> transposes the current result
